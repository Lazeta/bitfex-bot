# Bitfex Trade Bot

Just a simple minimal implementation of BitFex trade bot in Ruby.

Usage is simple:

```bash
bundle
EMAIL=your@mail.trade PASSWORD=sup3r PAIRS=BTC_RUR,ETH_USD bundle exec bot.rb
```

For now bot just takes rates from wex/bitflip and make orders, then close orders.

More implementation details, refactoring and so on coming soon :-)
